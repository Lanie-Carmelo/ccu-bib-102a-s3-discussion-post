<p>The conversion stories of Cornelius <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House, 1996, Acts 10–11)</span> and
Saul <span class="citation" data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House,
1996, Acts 9; 22; 26)</span> reveal how the gospel transcends cultural
boundaries and radically transforms individuals. In both cases, the
death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are central to the apostles’
message. Peter tells Cornelius that Jesus was crucified and raised to
life, and that forgiveness is available to all who believe in Him <span
class="citation" data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House, 1996, Acts
10:39–43)</span>. Similarly, Saul encounters the risen Christ directly,
which becomes the foundation of his entire ministry.</p>
<p>In both stories, the apostles emphasize that salvation comes through
faith in Jesus and obedience to His call. Peter tells Cornelius that
“everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his
name” <span class="citation" data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House,
1996, Acts 10:43)</span>. Saul is told to “be baptized and wash away
your sins, calling on his name” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House, 1996, Acts 22:16)</span>.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit plays a vital role in both conversions. Cornelius and
his household receive the Spirit before baptism, affirming that God
accepts Gentiles without distinction <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House, 1996, Acts 10:44–48)</span>.
Many Jews tried to claim that gentiles needed to do specific things to
be saved <span class="citation"
data-cites="elwellEncounteringNewTestament2022">(Elwell &amp; Yarbrough,
2022, Chapter 15)</span>, but these conversions challenge that view and
affirm that salvation is by faith, not ritual. Saul is filled with the
Spirit after his baptism, empowering him to preach boldly <span
class="citation" data-cites="Tyndale1996">(Tyndale House, 1996, Acts
9:17–20)</span>.</p>
<p>Other passages like <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tyndale1996">Tyndale House (1996, John 3:5)</span>, <span
class="citation" data-cites="Tyndale1996">Tyndale House (1996, Romans
8:9–11)</span>, and <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tyndale1996">Tyndale House (1996, Titus 3:5–6)</span>
clarify that the Holy Spirit is essential for regeneration, guidance,
and assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>These stories remind me that salvation is not limited by background,
ability, culture, or past mistakes. Whether a Roman centurion or a
persecutor of Christians, anyone can be transformed by the grace of
Jesus and the power of the Spirit. They challenge me to share the gospel
boldly and inclusively, trusting that God can work in anyone’s life.</p>
<p>These stories resonate with my own coming to faith in profound ways.
I grew up as a Christian, but because I only knew the King James Version
of the Bible, which I struggled to understand, my faith never felt as
strong as it could be. I learned about Jesus mostly through Christian
television programs and music. In 2014, I went through a period of deep
isolation and pain. My caregiver, my mom, was temporarily out of the
picture, and I was living with untreated fibromyalgia, alone and unable
to leave an upstairs apartment. During that time, I began searching for
a church and a Bible I could understand. That’s when missionaries from
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints knocked on my door. They
offered support and seemed to have answers when I felt most vulnerable,
and I quickly joined. But over time, I became increasingly unhappy. I
was pressured to tithe despite financial hardship, to attend temple
services that were physically exhausting, and to meet expectations that
didn’t align with my health or understanding of grace. With my mom’s
help and growing spiritual discomfort, I made the difficult decision to
leave. That choice cost me relationships, including someone who had
called me her adopted granddaughter, but it also opened the door to
healing. Like Saul, I had to walk away from something that once felt
right in order to truly follow Jesus. Through my current church and my
studies at CCU, I’m learning and growing in faith daily, just as
Cornelius and Saul did after their encounters with the gospel.</p>
